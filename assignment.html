        <p class="name">Dear Mr Wheeler,</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I bought a red, 2005, Buzuki Whiz fro your garage on 
            the 16th July 2016 and I am very unhappy with it. I have tried calling you a number if times but as soon 
            as I give my name, I am cut off. I am writing this formal letter  of complaint to inform you of the serious
             issues I ha ve had with this vehicle and what I expect from you as a result</p>
        <p>I started having problems just days after I bought the car from you. These issues include thick
            smoke coming from the exhaust, faukty windscreen wipers , a heater which only blows cold air, a 
            broken horn and just yesterday one of the wing mirrors fell off. Mr Wheeler, you told me that this 
            car was in excellent condition.</p>
        <p>First of all, I demand a full refund by the end of the month. Secondly, the car is sitting in our driveway 
            and I expect that someone will come to collect it by the end of the week. Please be aware that if my expectations
             are not met, I will be taking matters further.</p>
        <p>Your sincerely,</p>
        <p class="signature">Mr S.Holmes</p>
